PLAN OF ATTACK
+ Overarching goal: 
  + Create a place for users to keep a running track of their health - temperature, how they’re feeling 
      + Show a graph of your temperature over the past x # of days/weeks/months
  + Show a map visual of where people who have tested positive have been in the past 2 weeks
      + On a map, show locations and timestamps of where these people have been (anonymously)
      + This will give users more insight into where high-risk areas might be so that you can avoid them
  + Tracking users’ locations (can choose to be manual) and store a timestamp of where the user 
      + When someone tests positive, release their locations/timestamps anonymously on the map
  + Define features to encourage widespread adoption
      + “Some have estimated that for contact-tracing apps to stop contagion, adoption would need to be at least 60% of the population”
      + The contact-tracing app should be designed so it is instantly valuable to anyone in the targeted community who downloads it.
  + Perspective: college town residents are subject to the rash and unpredictable behavior of students during this time. Communities have expressed concern about students returning to campus → app used for student population, but also open to the surrounding community
      + Protect the community
      + More transparency for individuals so they can better understand where high risk areas might be so they can make better informed decisions
      + Make them feel + actually be safer in their own hometowns
  + Database stuff:
      + Installed sqlite through expo
      + Import everything from  expo sqlite as sqlite.
